V 0.0.1

-> Features Expected:
  - elm::mptr fully working
  
  -> Allocator:
    - No memory loss
    
    -> Coalescing
      - Coalesce with previous block 
      - Coalesce with next block 
    -> Requesting blocks
      - Split initial block
      - Policy: split initial block further or try to best fit?
        - Now it splits the initial block

      - When trying to request a free block,
        if the Allocator cannot retrieve one,
        do a coalesce pass and try to get a block again
